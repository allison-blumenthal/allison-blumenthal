I’m Allison — a rose-colored glasses kind of software developer, passionate about investing energy into what makes the world a better place. I constantly search for ways to grow, change, and improve, and work hard to flourish wherever I am while nourishing those around me.

Over the past decade, I have walked many paths that allowed me to impact the lives of others through music, education, and publishing. On my current journey as a developer, I continue to seek opportunities to bring positive change to the world through code. 

My diverse career experiences have feathered my nest with integral skills like communication, collaboration, detail-orientation, and time-management. Combined with my unwavering work ethic, full-stack technical skills, and emotional intelligence, I'm looking forward to exploring opportunities to make a difference as a developer.
