I’m Allison — a software developer committed to using my technical skills for the wellbeing of all. With a positive spirit and an eagerness to grow, I thrive in both collaborative and independent environments, continuously iterating and improving while uplifting those around me. 

Drawing from my background in music, education, and curriculum editing, I have a heart for projects that prioritize people and am passionate about creating products and experiences that foster joy and enrich lives. 

Whether through software development, music, or education, I've been fortunate to contribute to positive change and am continuously seeking opportunities to make an impact at the intersection of technology and human connection.
