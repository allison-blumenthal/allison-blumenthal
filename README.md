Hey there - I'm Allison. Previously a collaborative pianist, music educator, and music curriculum editor, I am now pursuing a career as a software engineer. I am currently enrolled in Nashville Software School's full-stack web development bootcamp, and will be graduating in September '23. With a background in music collaboration, classroom education, and editing for publishing, I have acquired strong problem-solving, team-work, and communication skills. I love connecting with and empowering people, working side-by-side with others to achieve things as a team, and pursuing new knowledge to improve and add to the skills I bring to the table.
