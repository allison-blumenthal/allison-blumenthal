👋🏼 Hey! I’m Allison—a full-stack developer with a passion for positivity, collaboration, problem-solving, and creativity. I started dabbling in code out of the desire to build a brighter future for my family. After years of hustling my heart out and wearing countless hats as a musician, I was ready for a more sustainable career. Not to mention my insatiable hunger to learn and grow—if you stop growing, you start dying, right?

🏫 Well, I’m rounding the corner on completing a 12-month apprenticeship at Nashville Software School with a tech stack of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Next.js, Python, Django, SQL, and Git/GitHub. I am eager to jump into my first role and contribute to the wild and wonderful world of software development.

🚀 With a unique background in music, education, and publishing, I have a strong foundation of communication, collaboration, and detail-oriented skills. My unwavering work ethic and drive to iterate and improve has guided me throughout my career journey. I am looking for a company where I can learn, grow, and surpass expectations set for me. Let’s connect—I would love to explore opportunities together.
